if for some reason you have an issue and you cannot do this successfully it's fine you made a mistake somewhere, you can get help at office hours, just submit your hw with repl.it, this is just a bonus, we'll be practicing this workflow in class during the upcoming weeks.
Follow the prompts to commit your work with git add -A&& git commit -m "Message Here"
When you are done with your hw, make an empty repository on github.comor github.comand then go through the steps to push your local git repository.
Remember again this a bonus
Your link to your github is what you submit
If at any point you get stuck and can't get unstuck, copy and paste your code to repl.it and submit that.
Git issues is not an acceptable reason to not turn in this assignment, the git work is a bonus.
