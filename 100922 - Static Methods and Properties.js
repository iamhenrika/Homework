// Practice What You Learned
// Static Methods and Properties
// class Governor {}
// There is only one Governor in the state, add static methods and properties you'd expect a Governor to have.

// Your base class

// Person{constructor(){}}
// Think of three properties all people share, set them with the constructor
// Think of three methods all people share
// Create a PostalWorker class that inherits from person, add some methods
// Create a Chef class that inherits from person, add some methods
// Create 2 PostalWorkers and 2 Chefs, log them and test all their methods
